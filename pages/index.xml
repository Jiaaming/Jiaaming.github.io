&lt;p>Hi, I’m James Liu (刘佳铭). I wrote ramdom stuff at my &lt;a href="https://cogitovault.jamesliu.space" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
CogitoVault
&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="study">Study&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>I was born and raised in Beijing, where I spent my primary, middle, and high school years all at the same &lt;a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/dq18K2RibzRf4jSP6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
school
&lt;/a>. Interestingly, my kindergarten was right next door—quite the convenient setup!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Feeling ready for a change, I moved to Shanghai for my undergraduate degree at &lt;a href="https://english.ecnu.edu.cn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
East China Normal University
&lt;/a>, studying Software Engineering from 2020 to 2024. I also spent a year at UC Berkeley (2022–2023) and a few months at the University of Alberta (Winter 2024) as an RA. After living in three different countries, I’ve realized I’d love to settle on the West Coast—somewhere with sunsets and pleasant weather.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
