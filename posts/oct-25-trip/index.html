The city center lies at the confluence of the Red and Assiniboine rivers, an area known as &ldquo;The Forks,&rdquo; which has been a place of trade and gathering for various tribes for thousands of years. This is also the birthplace of the Métis people—descendants of Indigenous peoples and French settlers, who are a highly representative group in Canada&rsquo;s modern multicultural narrative.</p><p><figure class=image-figure><img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jiaaming/blogImage/main/pic/5109DE06-E0EF-4876-9732-4568C554BEC9_1_105_c.jpeg alt="The banks of the Red River"><figcaption class=image-caption>The banks of the Red River</figcaption></figure></p><p>Manitoba is also an officially bilingual province, with English and French used side-by-side.

In the early 20th century, the city was known for its labor movement, and the 1919 Winnipeg General Strike was one of the largest labor actions in Canadian history. As a result, the city has dense public housing, and its murals often feature realistic or social themes, which is quite rare in other Canadian cities.</p><p><figure class=image-figure><img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jiaaming/blogImage/main/pic/F29E36DC-20A1-4B62-8A11-E3CEA6594732_1_105_c.jpeg alt="A city mural depicting the community’s history and life."><figcaption class=image-caption>A city mural depicting the community’s history and life.</figcaption></figure></p><p>After getting off the plane, my first stop was the Canadian Museum for Human Rights.</p><p><figure class=image-figure><img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jiaaming/blogImage/main/pic/B9513CC9-F01F-40BA-BFEF-B75903B2D2FA_1_105_c.jpeg alt="The museum has a unique architectural design, with interwoven glass and stone, symbolizing “humanity’s journey from darkness to light.”"><figcaption class=image-caption>The museum has a unique architectural design, with interwoven glass and stone, symbolizing “humanity’s journey from darkness to light.”</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure class=image-figure><img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jiaaming/blogImage/main/pic/9756B75E-EBB9-47E4-89D2-C63E816CAE8A_1_105_c.jpeg alt="Confucius isn’t bad."><figcaption class=image-caption>Confucius isn’t bad.</figcaption></figure></p><p>The exhibits inside combine artistic installations with written narratives, covering a vast range of topics from the injustices faced by Indigenous peoples to colonialism, slavery, and contemporary issues of gender equality and immigration.

GPT provided several common explanations:</p><ul><li>Forced out of many traditional industries, they had to cultivate expertise in fields that rely on knowledge and critical thinking.</li><li>Their culture places an extreme emphasis on education, reason, and dialectical thinking.</li><li>They have a strong, tightly-knit community with traditions of mutual support and reinvestment.</li><li>Historical suffering has forged a powerful collective resilience and drive to succeed.</li></ul><p>After reaching high positions in society, they often use their influence to promote and protect the interests of their community. Discussions about &ldquo;Jewish capital&rdquo; are common on the simplified Chinese internet—regardless of whether these views are extreme, I believe the &ldquo;long-term thinking&rdquo; and &ldquo;group consciousness&rdquo; demonstrated by the Jewish community at institutional and cultural levels are worth considering and learning from for the Chinese community.</p><hr><p>After spending five days at home studying for my midterm exams, I immediately flew to Montreal.</p><h2 id=-montreal--quebec-city>🇨🇦 Montreal & Quebec City</h2><p>During my summer internship, a colleague strongly recommended I visit Montreal. Indeed, it&rsquo;s a city that makes a strong first impression: the French streetscapes, the charm of the Old Port, and the blend of modern architecture and avant-garde art. It has the efficiency of a North American metropolis yet retains a leisurely French rhythm.</p><p><figure class=image-figure><img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jiaaming/blogImage/main/pic/20251020235021.png alt="Montreal was once Canada’s largest city, its rise closely linked to its status as a shipping hub on the St. Lawrence River-Great Lakes waterway."><figcaption class=image-caption>Montreal was once Canada’s largest city, its rise closely linked to its status as a shipping hub on the St. Lawrence River-Great Lakes waterway.</figcaption></figure></p><h3 id=montreal-trade-conflict-and-peace>Montreal: Trade, Conflict, and Peace</h3><p><figure class=image-figure><img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jiaaming/blogImage/main/pic/DCE9A8E3-B001-49F2-8AC3-C9BBACF92026_1_105_c.jpeg alt="Notre-Dame Basilica of Montreal, a masterpiece of 19th-century Gothic Revival architecture, with its visually stunning blue and gold ceiling."><figcaption class=image-caption>Notre-Dame Basilica of Montreal, a masterpiece of 19th-century Gothic Revival architecture, with its visually stunning blue and gold ceiling.</figcaption></figure></p><p>Contrary to popular belief, Montreal truly began to develop after the British took over. During the French rule, Quebec&rsquo;s political center was Quebec City, and Montreal was just a small trading post.</p><p>In the early 17th century, a small group of French settlers arrived here and constantly clashed with the Indigenous peoples. Due to limited support from the French crown, the colonists were not militarily superior. Ultimately, it was the Indigenous peoples who took the initiative to propose a peace treaty to promote trade. <strong>The Great Peace of Montreal, signed in 1701,</strong> was a rare, relatively equal treaty in North American history that brought decades of peace to the region. It was only later, after diseases brought from Europe decimated the Indigenous population, that French colonists were able to gradually expand.</p><p><figure class=image-figure><img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jiaaming/blogImage/main/pic/20251103165908.png alt="An exhibit at the Pointe-à-Callière Montréal Archaeology and History Complex, showing the diversity of the residents’ origins.

The descendants of French colonists here believe that they were initially focused on trade and did not engage in large-scale land appropriation. Instead, they see themselves as having been conquered by the British, becoming &ldquo;the ruled&rdquo; themselves.</p><p><figure class=image-figure><img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jiaaming/blogImage/main/pic/041AC875-BDD9-4B28-96C8-F2C91D9AD0CF_1_105_c.jpeg alt="Overlooking downtown Montreal from Mount Royal.

Maurice Duplessis, the conservative leader who came to power in 1936, maintained a society deeply dominated by the Catholic Church under the pretext of &ldquo;protecting French-Canadian culture.&rdquo; Education, healthcare, and labor unions were all under its influence.</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t until after Duplessis&rsquo;s death in the 1960s that Quebec experienced the <em>&ldquo;Quiet Revolution&rdquo; (Révolution tranquille)</em>—a peaceful transition to modernity. The government took back control of education and healthcare, weakened the church&rsquo;s influence, promoted industrialization and public services, and established a secular education system. The cultural confidence and identity of Quebec today were established during this period.</p><p><figure class=image-figure><img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jiaaming/blogImage/main/pic/D04275DC-F2D6-4EE2-8327-F820C3E01238_1_105_c.jpeg alt="Mary, Queen of the World Cathedral, during a Mass."><figcaption class=image-caption>Mary, Queen of the World Cathedral, during a Mass.</figcaption></figure></p><h3 id=quebec-city-a-historical-fortress>Quebec City: A Historical Fortress</h3><p>Taking a train north from Montreal, I arrived in Quebec City.</p><p><figure class=image-figure><img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jiaaming/blogImage/main/pic/1E07BC50-0990-4C10-B6DD-ADB49B82C49A_1_105_c.jpeg alt="Taking the train from Montreal to Quebec City."><figcaption class=image-caption>Taking the train from Montreal to Quebec City.</figcaption></figure></p><p>The landmark here, the Château Frontenac, is said to be the most photographed hotel in the world (ft. its official website <a href=https://www.chateau-frontenac.com/en/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">description

In fact, the country&rsquo;s prototype was born from a French colony, and by the time it was seized by Britain in 1763, it already had a rich French-speaking community. The coexistence and interplay between the English and French descendants form Canada&rsquo;s national narrative of &ldquo;two founding peoples,&rdquo; which extends to today&rsquo;s institutional guarantees of multiculturalism.</p><p>Preserving the French language is not just about cultural diversity; it&rsquo;s about maintaining this historical narrative. Otherwise, Canada would be culturally almost indistinguishable from the United States. This also explains why the government insists on bringing in French-speaking immigrants through various programs, even if many just see it as a shortcut to immigration. The political significance behind this far outweighs the economic considerations. <del>It&rsquo;s like how the CCP absolutely needs the unification of both sides of the strait.</del></p><p>Of course, this policy also creates real-world conflicts. Quebec&rsquo;s language laws require business signs to be predominantly in French. The most famous example is KFC being forced to change its name to PFK (Poulet Frit Kentucky). The push and pull between protecting French and promoting economic openness is an ongoing issue for Quebec and all of Canada.</p><p>Furthermore, unlike Spanish-style colonial rule, the relationship between Indigenous peoples and colonists in North America was not simply one of invader and invaded; it was a history rich with interaction and fusion. These relationships were often driven by trade, geopolitics, and inter-tribal rivalries, full of complex alliances and maneuvering.</p><p>For example, in the early 17th century, French explorer Samuel de Champlain, to secure the lucrative fur trade, formed military alliances with Indigenous tribes like the Huron-Wendat and the Algonquin. The French used firearms to help them fight against their traditional enemy, the powerful Iroquois Confederacy. In response, the Iroquois Confederacy sided first with the Dutch and later with the British, creating a standoff that lasted for over a century.</p><p>These alliances were not static. Indigenous tribes were highly autonomous political entities that chose which European power to cooperate with based on their own interests. This complex interaction forms an equally important narrative thread in the history of North American colonization.</p><hr><h2 id=-ottawa>🇨🇦 Ottawa</h2><p>After a five-day stay in Quebec, I flew to Canada&rsquo;s capital, Ottawa.

This was also largely true for the rest of my trip. After a little research, I found that while the female labor force participation rate in Puerto Rico is lower than in the mainland U.S., women are unusually active in the gig economy, such as ride-sharing. This might be related to local family structures and the demand for flexible work hours. The proportion of female drivers here is about 20% higher than the U.S. mainland average, which is interesting.</p><p><figure class=image-figure><img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jiaaming/blogImage/main/pic/E3FBD3F0-BF69-4124-8032-5A931C0B4883_1_105_c.jpeg alt="Castillo San Cristóbal, built to defend against land attacks."><figcaption class=image-caption>Castillo San Cristóbal, built to defend against land attacks.</figcaption></figure></p><p>The most famous historical sites here are the fortifications that the Spanish spent centuries building, considered the strongest in the Caribbean.

Today, Puerto Rico&rsquo;s per capita GDP is about half that of the U.S. mainland. Its standard of living is far better than most Latin American countries, but the gap is still significant.</p><p>As a former Spanish colony, this place also made me ponder a phenomenon: why have the vast majority of former Spanish colonies (the countries of Latin America) struggled on the path to modernization, often falling into structural imbalances, while many former British colonies (like the U.S., Canada, Australia, Singapore), despite their own cruel and bloody histories, managed to establish relatively stable modern nations? Some say it&rsquo;s because they completely slaughtered the indigenous populations, but the Spanish were even more brutal in their slaughter, yet failed to establish a better model.</p><p>Historians often compare two different colonial models: Spanish colonial rule was more of a &ldquo;resource extraction&rdquo; type. The societies it established were hierarchical with highly concentrated power, designed to funnel the wealth of the New World back to the mother country. The institutional legacy it left behind was often oligarchy and economic dependence.</p><p>British colonization, especially in North America, was more focused on &ldquo;settler societies.&rdquo; It transplanted a whole system including common law, private property rights, and parliamentary institutions, which laid the foundation for later capitalist development.</p><p>Of course, history is far more complex than this simple division. The education I received from a young age accustomed me to seeing colonizers as purely oppressors—even as completely dehumanized, brutal &ldquo;monsters.&rdquo; But now I&rsquo;m gradually realizing that simply labeling historical individuals as &ldquo;evil&rdquo; is itself a form of intellectual laziness, a reverse &ldquo;dehumanization.&rdquo; This perspective ignores the immense shaping power of institutions, environment, and the prevailing ideas of the time on individuals.</p><p>Ironically, the reason colonizers were able to commit such atrocities was precisely because of their &ldquo;dehumanizing&rdquo; view of the colonized indigenous peoples—seeing them as backward, ignorant &ldquo;others&rdquo; who could be dominated at will. It was by stripping them of their &ldquo;humanity&rdquo; that exploitation and enslavement became justifiable. This is also the root of many historical tragedies.</p><p>Of course, the ideas and behaviors we take for granted today might, to people hundreds of years from now, also contain some blind spots and &ldquo;dehumanization&rdquo; that we are unaware of.</p><h2 id=-new-york>🇺🇸 New York</h2><p>I had only planned to transit through New York on my way back to Canada, but a heavy rainstorm on October 30th completely upended my plans.

At that time, our group took a charter bus to tour the East Coast. To avoid being found out by the education bureau, we didn&rsquo;t even dare to post photos online publicly 🤣 (though the program was canceled the next year, which was a pity), so I have few records of it. I only remember it was a cloudy, rainy afternoon, and my 15-year-old self and a friend were wandering aimlessly on the streets of New York.</p><p>When we got to Times Square, I was completely stunned by the scene before me: huge billboards flashed with dazzling neon lights, changing colors in the post-rain mist, looking extremely cyberpunk.

The world has changed dramatically in these few short years.</p><p><figure class=image-figure><img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jiaaming/blogImage/main/pic/BE573C61-4C56-4CD8-9F30-4F07C28832E4_1_105_c.jpeg alt="Walked 30,000 steps in one day, probably the most eventful and interesting day of my travels."><figcaption class=image-caption>Walked 30,000 steps in one day, probably the most eventful and interesting day of my travels.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure class=image-figure><img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jiaaming/blogImage/main/pic/94694C75-22E8-4D9D-A0EA-16AEE00680D2_1_105_c.jpeg alt="The next morning, I had a meal with a middle school classmate and took a short stroll around Brooklyn."><figcaption class=image-caption>The next morning, I had a meal with a middle school classmate and took a short stroll around Brooklyn.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure class=image-figure><img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jiaaming/blogImage/main/pic/532596DE-6E71-4E7D-B9EB-7D10D28282C9_1_105_c.jpeg alt="Flew out of New York in the afternoon."><figcaption class=image-caption>Flew out of New York in the afternoon.</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure class=image-figure><img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jiaaming/blogImage/main/pic/30D92FE3-4253-48F8-A5C1-72E33D6B97AE_1_105_c.jpeg alt="Vancouver on the morning of November 2nd."><figcaption class=image-caption>Vancouver on the morning of November 2nd.</figcaption></figure></p></div></article></main></div><footer class=footer><span class=footer_item></span>&nbsp;<div class=footer_social-icons><a href=https://github.com/jiaaming target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer me" title=Github><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M9 19c-5 1.5-5-2.5-7-3m14 6v-3.87a3.37 3.37.0 00-.94-2.61c3.14-.35 6.44-1.54 6.44-7A5.44 5.44.0 0020 4.77 5.07 5.07.0 0019.91 1S18.73.65 16 2.48a13.38 13.38.0 00-7 0C6.27.65 5.09 1 5.09 1A5.07 5.07.0 005 4.77 5.44 5.44.0 003.5 8.55c0 5.42 3.3 6.61 6.44 7A3.37 3.37.0 009 18.13V22"/></svg>
