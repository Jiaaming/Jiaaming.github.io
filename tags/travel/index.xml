&lt;p>The day after my internship ended, I set off to explore Eastern Canada.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Halifax and St. John&amp;rsquo;s were essentially Britain&amp;rsquo;s two most important cities in Canada before they took over French territories in 1763â€”one a military stronghold, the other a fishing hub.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Before diving in, a quick history refresher is necessary: The Seven Years&amp;rsquo; War (1756-1763), known in North America as the &amp;ldquo;French and Indian War,&amp;rdquo; was essentially the decisive battle between the British and French empires for North American dominance. During the war, British forces not only conquered French Canada but also secured important victories in India and the Caribbean. The Treaty of Paris, signed February 10, 1763, formally ended the conflictâ€”France ceded all North American territory east of the Mississippi River (except New Orleans) to Britain, while Spain handed Florida to Britain in exchange for Cuba.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>ğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡²ğŸ‡¾ğŸ‡¹ğŸ‡¼ğŸ‡¯ğŸ‡µ Travel Logs v2025.04: 8 cities</title><link>https://jamesliu.space/posts/apr-25-trip/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jamesliu.space/posts/apr-25-trip/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>Originally written in &lt;a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/EZarQ0hLPy-2IEjNC7Yo3g" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

&lt;h2 id="-singapore">ğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡¬ Singapore&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I took a direct &lt;a href="https://www.flightaware.com/live/flight/ACA19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
16-hour flight
&lt;/a> from Vancouver to Singaporeâ€”the world&amp;rsquo;s second-longest commercial route, beaten only by the 18-hour New York-Singapore leg. I thought it would be brutal, but after popping two melatonin pills, I slept through about 12 hours of it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Landing at 7 AM, I took the metro from the airport into the city to my hostel. By 8 AM, the trains were already packed with foreign workers heading into the cityâ€”mostly exhausted South Asian men in worn clothing, a stark contrast to the local white-collar commuters. Of course, Singapore&amp;rsquo;s inequality toward foreign workers is hardly breaking news.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
