&lt;p>After returning from Cancun, I spent weeks waiting for results from my December 18th interview. Amazon didn&amp;rsquo;t send the offer until January 7th—ironically, after two or three weeks of silence, I actually became more confident I&amp;rsquo;d gotten it, since rejections usually come much faster.

Getting an internship locked down in January was completely beyond what I&amp;rsquo;d expected before leaving China—I&amp;rsquo;d estimated it would take until March or April. I recorded a &lt;a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1xLcMefEeV/?share_source=copy_web&amp;amp;vd_source=2e95f8b32aa6f76a3d42bad6b38256a3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
video about my Canadian internship search experience
&lt;/a> on Bilibili, and unexpectedly connected with quite a few like-minded people through it, which strengthened my determination to create and share more content going forward.

The whole point of this master&amp;rsquo;s program was to find a job, so once that goal was achieved, I felt completely justified in coasting through my remaining courses. I spent the rest of my time researching crypto/investment-related topics and various tax-advantaged accounts and convoluted tax rules—basically figured out my risk tolerance through trial and error. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably need to dive deeper into this later.

In February, out of sheer boredom, I took a trip to Toronto—it was freezing. But I was really impressed by the underground PATH system that connects almost all the office buildings. A friend I went with knew someone at Amazon Toronto who gave us a tour of the office.

The rest of the semester until the end was pretty rough. Vancouver&amp;rsquo;s perpetually overcast weather and 5 PM sunsets made things quite depressing. Having read plenty of horror stories about Amazon online, I was also worried about landing in a toxic team (turned out to be completely unnecessary), so my mood wasn&amp;rsquo;t as relaxed as I&amp;rsquo;d expected.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>2024 Year-End Review</title><link>https://jamesliu.space/posts/life-24-review/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jamesliu.space/posts/life-24-review/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Note&lt;/strong>: This is a translation of my Chinese year-end review.

&lt;p>People often say they want to go back to the past because they&amp;rsquo;re not happy with the present—but honestly, I&amp;rsquo;ve never really wanted to go back.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>2023 Year-End Review</title><link>https://jamesliu.space/posts/life-23-review/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jamesliu.space/posts/life-23-review/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Note&lt;/strong>: This is a translation of my Chinese year-end review.

&lt;p>The weirdest feeling I had this year was probably when people asked my age.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>If I were to summarize my 2022, the pandemic would definitely be an unavoidable topic. Most of my growth, changes, thoughts, emotions, and confusion this year were closely tied to it—though I didn&amp;rsquo;t want it that way.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
