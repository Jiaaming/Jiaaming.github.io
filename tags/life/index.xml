&lt;p>People often say they want to go back to the past because they&amp;rsquo;re not happy with the present—but honestly, I&amp;rsquo;ve never really wanted to go back.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>2023 Year-End Review</title><link>https://jamesliu.space/posts/life-23-review/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jamesliu.space/posts/life-23-review/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Note&lt;/strong>: This is a translation of my Chinese year-end review.
